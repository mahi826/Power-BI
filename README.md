## Power-BI

**Sales Dashboard North Sea Exports**

*In my recent project, I designed and developed a robust Power BI dashboard utilizing the North Sea Exports dataset to deliver comprehensive insights into sales performance and customer behavior. The dashboard seamlessly integrates various key performance indicators, including total unique orders, customers, quantity sold, and sales generated, while also offering insights into regional sales distribution and top customers and products. By incorporating slicers for easy filtering based on channels such as Industries, Import, and Export, users can dynamically interact with the data, enabling informed decision-making. This project underscores my proficiency in Power BI, data visualization, and analytics, showcasing my ability to transform raw data into actionable insights for business stakeholders.*
