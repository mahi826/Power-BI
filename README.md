## Power-BI

**Sales Dashboard North Sea Exports**

*In my recent project, I designed and developed a robust Power BI dashboard utilizing the North Sea Exports dataset to deliver comprehensive insights into sales performance and customer behavior. The dashboard seamlessly integrates various key performance indicators, including total unique orders, customers, quantity sold, and sales generated, while also offering insights into regional sales distribution and top customers and products. By incorporating slicers for easy filtering based on channels such as Industries, Import, and Export, users can dynamically interact with the data, enabling informed decision-making. This project underscores my proficiency in Power BI, data visualization, and analytics, showcasing my ability to transform raw data into actionable insights for business stakeholders.*

**Forbes American College Dashboard**

*The "Forbes American College Dashboard" in Power BI offers a concise yet comprehensive view of key metrics regarding American colleges and universities. It includes data on total student enrollment, top 10 colleges, acceptance rates, and the minimum and maximum marks required for admission. The dashboard also presents a comparison between university rankings and alumni salaries, shedding light on the relationship between educational quality and post-graduation financial outcomes. Additionally, financial insights such as endowment size, revenue sources, and expenditure patterns provide a deeper understanding of the financial landscape within higher education institutions. This dashboard serves as a valuable resource for administrators, policymakers, and prospective students, aiding in informed decision-making regarding college selection, investment strategies, and institutional planning.*
